        <h1>ABOUT NARUTO</h1>
        <p ><b>Naruto is an anime series based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga series of the same name. The series centers on the adventures of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village,
             searching for recognitions and wishing to become the ninja by the rest of the village to be the leader and the strongest of all.</b></p>

                    <h3>HIDDEN LEAF</h3>
                    <p>The symbol stands for leaf. When Madara Uchiha and Hashirama Senju founded the village of Konoho 
                        (village Hidden in the Leaves), Hashirama asked Madara to name the village. Graphical characteristics: 
                        Asymmetric, Open shape, Monochrome, Contains both straight and curved lines, Has no crossing lines.</p>

                    <h3>HIDDEN SAND</h3>
                    <p>Sunagakure (砂隠れの里, Sunagakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Sand) is the hidden 
                        village of the Land of Wind. As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Sunagakure
                         has a Kage as its leader known as the Kazekage, of which there have been five in its history. 
                         Being surrounded by desert offers the village a natural deterrent against invasion, as
                         few foreign powers would be willing to endure the sandstorms and water scarcity common to Suna.</p>

                    <h3>HIDDEN RAIN</h3>
                    <p>Amegakure (known better as "The Village Hidden in Rain") is a small, yet highly industrialized 
                        hidden village located in an unnamed country. A number of smaller villages also surround Amegakure.
                         As its name suggests, it rains almost constantly due to a storm above the village. Many
                         shinobis from this village seem to wear a kind of mask that allows them to breathe underwater.</p>
