            <p>Cassius, Casca, and their allies plant false documents to manipulate Brutus to join their cause to remove
                Caesar.
                After doing so, they visit Brutus at night in his home to persuade him of their views. There they plan
                Caesar's
                death. Brutus is troubled but refuses to confide in his devoted wife, Portia. On 15 March, Caesar's
                wife,
                Calpurnia, urges him not to go to the Senate. She has had visionary dreams and fears the portents of the
                overnight storms.Against Cassius's advice, Brutus allows Mark Antony to speak a funeral oration for
                Caesar in
                the market place. He is allowed under the condition that first Brutus must address the people to explain
                the
                conspirators' reasons and their fears for Caesar's ambition. After Brutus speaks, the crowd becomes calm
                and
                supports his cause. However, Antony, in his speech, questions the motives of the conspirators and
                reminds the
                crowd of Caesar's benevolent actions and of his refusal to accept the crown. He also reads them Caesar's
                will,
                in which Caesar leaves public land and money to each Roman citizen. Antony's speech stirs the crowd into
                a
                murderous riot, and the conspirators are forced to flee from the city.</p>
